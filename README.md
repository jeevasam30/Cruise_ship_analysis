# Cruise Ship Performance Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for analyzing the performance trends of two cruise ships (Vessel 1 and Vessel 2).
This project aims to analyze various aspects of the ships' operations using Python and SQL, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as efficiency, propulsion systems, power generation, and more.

## Background
Data given is of two Cruise ships for an year from Januray 1st to Deceber 31, 2023 in 5 minute inteval. The condition or destination in which the ships have travelled is not given.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset files used for analysis.
- **scripts/**
  - **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing and cleaning the dataset.
  - **Vessel1_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook focusing on performance trends of Vessel 1.
  - **Vessel2_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook focusing on performance trends of Vessel 2.
  - **utilities.py**: Python script containing utility functions used across analysis notebooks.(this conatins all the helper functions)
- **documents/**: This folder contains all the documents neccessary for this project.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `Data_cleaning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the Data_clean_function to get the cleaned data.
5. Run each cell in vessel1_analysis, where you can observe trends of different KPI and narrative in the begining of each cell.

## Key Components

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and converting data types.
- EDA: Visualizing distributions and exploring correlations.
- KPIs: Calculating efficiency metrics and visualizing trends.
- Narrative Development: Summarizing findings and insights.
